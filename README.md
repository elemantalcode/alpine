Alpine Example
==============

Example of basic vagrant docker provider for Alpine distro

Requirements
------------

+ docker
+ vagrant
+ ansible

Usage
-----

```
   vagrant up
```

TODO
----

1. Not quite familiar with Alpine, so there's a lot of changes needed
2. Dockerfile could be neatened (too many RUN commands)
3. Vagrantfile needs work (port mapping etc)
